# Forest Fire and Pest Detection Device using NI myRIO and LabVIEW

This is a LabVIEW application that runs on an NI myRIO device and uses sensors to detect forest fires and pests in the surrounding environment. The system is designed to provide early warning for forest fires and help prevent them from spreading, as well as detect pests that can damage the ecosystem.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Real-time monitoring of the surrounding environment for forest fires and pests</li>
	<li>Early warning system to alert users of potential forest fires</li>
	<li>Accurate detection of pests that can damage the ecosystem</li>
	<li>Easy-to-use LabVIEW interface for configuring and controlling the system</li>
	<li>Support for multiple sensors and data sources</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardware Requirements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>NI myRIO device</li>
	<li>Sensors for detecting forest fires and pests (e.g., temperature sensors, CO2 sensors, etc.)</li>
</ul>
